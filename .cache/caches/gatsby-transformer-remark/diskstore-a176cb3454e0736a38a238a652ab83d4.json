From the cacao tree fruit comes many seeds that are known as cacao beans. These beans, in their raw state, have an exceptionally high nutritional value as a food. Cacao is a brilliantly complex food because it not just food for the body, but also for the mind.</p>\n<p>There are natural brain chemicals such as anandamide (bliss chemical), PEA (Phenethylamine – Love chemical), Dopamine (pleasure chemical), among others. All of these chemicals stimulate the brain, making you feel so very good. The more we feel good, the more we are inspired to be and do good!</p>\n<p>ANTIOXIDANTS = ANTI-PROBLEMS</p>\n<p>Cacao is also rich in antioxidants. In fact, it has the highest amount of antioxidants in any food (50x more than blueberries)! We all know that antioxidants are essential for slowing down the aging process and help fight unwanted diseases and illnesses.</p>\n<p>HEART ACTIVATION</p>\n<p>Cacao is a heart medicine, because it literally opens the heart up physically by allowing the muscles to relax and allow more blood flow. More blood to the heart means more to be pumped around the body. Eat chocolate a day and you can kiss the threat of a heart attack away!</p>\n<p>MIRACLE MINERAL MAGNESIUM</p>\n<p>Magnesium is the main mineral that helps your body relax and release physical tension. Cacao is the highest source of magnesium and it is said that more than 80% of our population is magnesium deficient. Magnesium turns on more than 300 enzymes in the body that play a specific role to keep the body functioning. Many of our health issues today are a direct link to magnesium deficiency. Who would’ve thought that eating chocolate could actually save us from all our medical problems! Here’s to aging wonderfully! “The beverage of the gods was Ambrosia; that of man is chocolate. Both increase the length of life in a prodigious manner.” – Louis Lewin, MD, Phantastica</p>\n<p>WHAT IS CEREMONIAL CACAO?</p>\n<p>In short, ceremonial cacao is cacao that is prepared with special prayers and intentions to activate more of the healing properties of this superfood.
